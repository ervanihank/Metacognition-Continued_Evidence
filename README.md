# Metacognition-Continued_Evidence

 The overall goal of my M2 project will be to clarify the **relationship between visual perceptual decisions and confidence judgments**

# Research Question

 - What would happen when the observer receives further counter-evidence after the perceptual decision had supposedly taken place.? 
   
 - Do they completely ignore this extra information since they are already done with the
   decision, or do they restart to accumulate further information at some point?  
   
 - What happens if there is a strong contradiction between the new sensory evidence and an already taken decision?

## Hzpothesis

When sufficient counter-evidence is presented after the decision is made, this new evidence is taken as an alert signal to help observers change their minds
